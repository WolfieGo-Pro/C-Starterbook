# C++ Starterbook.
Beginning my journey as a cross-platform C++ programmer for games, apps and embedded devices.
This starterbook contains C++98 & C++11 code I started with at age 16.
Hence, my self-education of statements, variables, loops, execution flow, compilers, linkers, header prototypes etc.
is depicted with this book/self-documentation. (The basic rules of programming)

The method of using this starterbook (and other starterbooks) to come, conveys that I'm talking & teaching myself. 
Therefore, comments and other notes in the starterbooks projects are written to facilitate my understanding of what I'm coding for.
As more starterbook projects are done, I'd have attained a deeper comprehension and intrinsic implementation of C++ code to explicitly 
write code in a program to solve a problem, question or build software and hardware, with simplicity in mind.
